How to import jupyter notebooks:
1. Truly recomend installing anaconda project from zero, at: https://www.anaconda.com
      * If you prefer docker, you can also: 
      https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/running.html
  
2. After installing anaconda, find jupyter notebook or jupyterLab(preferred one) and import the .ipynb files you want. 
      *Remember if you are managing other external files to put them in same folder - as for study.
